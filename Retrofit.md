# Retrofit for Android Development

---

Retrofit stands as a cornerstone in Android app development, offering a streamlined approach to handling network requests and managing API interactions efficiently. Leveraging Retrofit simplifies the process of integrating web services into your Android applications, enhancing flexibility and maintainability. This article comprehensively covers the fundamentals of Retrofit, from setup to integration with ViewModels, using Kotlin.

### Adding Retrofit to Your Project:

To begin using Retrofit in your Android project, include the necessary dependencies in your build.gradle(app) file:
```gradle
dependencies {
   implementation ("com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:$RETROFIT_VERS")
   implementation (“com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:RETROFIT_VERS”)
}
```
Ensure the version numbers match the latest available.

### Initializing Retrofit:

Initialize Retrofit with a base URL in your application setup, specifying where your API requests will be directed:

```kotlin
val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
		.baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
		.addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
		.build()
```  
Here, GsonConverterFactory.create() facilitates JSON serialization and deserialization using Gson. Retrofit supports various converters for other data formats.

### Creating API Interface:

Define an interface that outlines your API endpoints and the HTTP methods they employ:
```kotlin
interface ApiService {
	
		@GET("endpoint")
		fun getExampleData(): Call<ResponseBody>
		
		@POST("post\_endpoint")
		fun postData(@Body body: RequestBody): Call<ResponseBody>
	
		@GET("search")
		fun search(@Query("q") query: String, 
		@Header("Authorization") authToken: String): Call<ResponseBody>
	}
```
This interface delineates methods for various HTTP operations like GET and POST, illustrating how parameters are passed using annotations such as @Body, @Query, and @Header.

### Making API Calls:

Initiate network requests using Retrofit by creating an instance of your service interface and invoking its methods:
```kotlin
val service = retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)
	service.getExampleData().enqueue(object : Callback<ResponseBody> {
		override fun onResponse(call: Call<ResponseBody>, response: Response<ResponseBody>) {
			// Handle successful response
		}
	
		override fun onFailure(call: Call<ResponseBody>, t: Throwable) {
			// Handle failure
		}
	})
```
For POST requests, prepare the request body and pass it as an argument:
```kotlin
val requestBody = RequestBody.create(MediaType.parse("application/json"), jsonBody)
		service.postData(requestBody).enqueue(object : Callback<ResponseBody> {
		override fun onResponse(call: Call<ResponseBody>, response: Response<ResponseBody>) {
			// Handle successful response
		}
	
		override fun onFailure(call: Call<ResponseBody>, t: Throwable) {
			// Handle failure
		}
	})
```
### Handling Body, Headers, and Query Parameters:

- **Body** : Use the @Body annotation to pass the request body.
- **Headers**: Employ the @Header annotation to include headers in your requests.
- **Query Parameters**: Utilize the @Query annotation to append query parameters to your URL.

### Integrating with ViewModel:

Integrate Retrofit with ViewModels by creating a repository that interacts with Retrofit and provides data to your ViewModel:
```kotlin
class MyRepository {
		private val apiService: ApiService = retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)
		
		fun fetchDataFromApi(): LiveData<Resource<ResponseBody>> {
		
		val data = MutableLiveData<Resource<ResponseBody>>()
		apiService.getExampleData().enqueue(object : Callback<ResponseBody> {
		
		override fun onResponse(call: Call<ResponseBody>, response: Response<ResponseBody>) {
			if (response.isSuccessful) {
				data.value = Resource.success(response.body())
			} else {
				data.value = Resource.error("Error occurred", null)
			}
		}
				
		override fun onFailure(call: Call<ResponseBody>, t: Throwable) {
			data.value = Resource.error("Network error occurred", null)
		}
	})
		return data
		}
	}
```
Here, Resource is a custom class encapsulating various states of data (loading, success, error), ensuring proper handling and observation within ViewModels.

### Interceptors

Interceptors in Retrofit provide a powerful mechanism to intercept and manipulate outgoing requests and incoming responses. They are useful for tasks like adding headers, logging requests, handling authentication, and modifying request/response bodies. This article explores how interceptors work in Retrofit using Kotlin, including practical examples.

#### What are Interceptors?
Interceptors are components in Retrofit that can intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. They are added to the OkHttpClient instance that Retrofit uses internally to execute network requests. Interceptors can be used for various purposes such as authentication, logging, retrying requests, and more.

#### Adding Interceptors to Retrofit:
To add an interceptor, you need to modify the OkHttpClient instance used by Retrofit when building it:
```kotlin
val interceptor = Interceptor { chain ->
	
	val request = chain.request().newBuilder()
			.addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer token")
			.build()
		chain.proceed(request)
	}
	
	val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
			.addInterceptor(interceptor)
			.build()
	
	val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
			.baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
			.client(client)
			.addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
			.build()
```

In this example:
- An Interceptor is created where chain represents the intercepted request/response chain.
- Inside the interceptor, a new request is built using newBuilder() to add a header (Authorization header with a bearer token in this case).
- chain.proceed(request) is used to continue the request/response chain with the modified request.

#### Logging Interceptor:
One of the most common uses of interceptors is logging requests and responses for debugging purposes. Retrofit offers a built-in logging interceptor from OkHttp's logging module:
```kotlin
val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
		level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY
	}
	
	val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
		.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
		.build()
		
	val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
		.baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
		.client(client)
		.addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
		.build()
```
Here, HttpLoggingInterceptor is used to log the request and response bodies at BODY level. This helps in debugging network requests and responses effectively.

#### Chained Interceptors:

Interceptors can be chained together to perform multiple actions sequentially on requests and responses. For example, you might have one interceptor for adding headers and another for logging:
```kotlin
val headerInterceptor = Interceptor { chain ->
	
	val request = chain.request().newBuilder()
		.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
		.build()
		chain.proceed(request)
	}
	
	val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
		level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY
	}
	
	val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
		.addInterceptor(headerInterceptor)
		.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
		.build()
	
	val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
		.baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
		.client(client)
		.addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
		.build()
```
#### Authenticating with Interceptors:

Interceptors are commonly used for adding authentication tokens or credentials to requests. Here’s an example of an interceptor for adding a token to requests:
```kotlin
val token = "your\_auth\_token\_here"
	
	val authInterceptor = Interceptor { chain ->
	
	val request = chain.request().newBuilder()
		.addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer $token")
		.build()
		chain.proceed(request)
	}
	
	val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
		.addInterceptor(authInterceptor)
		.build()
	
	val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
		.baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
		.client(client)
		.addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
		.build()
```
